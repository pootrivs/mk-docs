Any unwanted access to these resources can make a system vulnerable by unauthorized operation on these resources. It may also lead to loss of sensitive data. Hence any unauthorized access to these resources should be prevented. </p> <p>oneM2M Access control Policies defines an authorization mechanism for oneM2M resources. These policies contain access control rules which define who is authorized to access these resources, what operations ( e.g. Create, Retrieve, Discover) are allowed, what attributes of these resources and under which conditions (e.g. time, location, IP address, limit) access is allowed for operating on oneM2M resources. </p> <p>Access control policies are also represented as a resource in the CSE.
